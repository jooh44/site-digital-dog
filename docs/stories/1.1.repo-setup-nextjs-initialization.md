# Story 1.1: Repo Setup & Next.js Initialization

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Setup
**Status:** DONE
**Sprint:** 1-2 (Semanas 1-2)
**Prioridade:** 🔴 Crítica

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize a Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and proper project structure,
**so that** I have a solid foundation to build the Digital Dog website with all necessary configurations in place.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub repository created and initialized with proper .gitignore
2. Next.js 14 project initialized with TypeScript and App Router
3. Project structure follows architecture directory layout
4. Basic configuration files created (package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.js)
5. Git repository properly configured with initial commit
6. Project runs locally without errors (`npm run dev`)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

N/A - This is the first story of the project.

### Technology Stack

[Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]

**Front-End Core:**

- Next.js 14.2+ (App Router) - React framework
- React 18+ - UI library
- TypeScript 5.3+ - Type-safe JavaScript

**Development Tools:**

- Node.js 20 LTS - Runtime
- npm - Package manager

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

The project must follow this directory structure:

```
digitaldog-website/
├── app/                        # Next.js App Router
│   ├── layout.tsx              # Root layout
│   ├── page.tsx                # Homepage
│   ├── globals.css             # Global styles
│   └── api/                    # API Routes (to be created later)
├── components/                 # React Components
│   ├── layout/                 # Header, Footer, Navigation
│   ├── sections/               # Homepage sections
│   ├── ui/                     # Reusable UI components
│   └── forms/                  # Form components
├── lib/                        # Utility functions
├── public/                     # Static assets
│   ├── images/
│   └── fonts/
├── prisma/                     # Database schema
├── styles/                      # Design System CSS
├── .github/workflows/          # CI/CD pipeline
├── .env.local                  # Environment variables (gitignored)
├── .env.example                # Template env vars
├── .gitignore
├── next.config.js
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── package.json
```

### File Naming Conventions

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Components: PascalCase (Button.tsx)
- Utilities: camelCase (analytics.ts)
- Pages: lowercase (page.tsx)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### TypeScript Configuration

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Use strict mode (`"strict": true`)
- Prefer interfaces over types for objects
- Use enums for fixed values
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` if necessary

### Git Commit Messages

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

Follow conventional commits format:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript`

### Next.js Configuration Notes

[Source: architecture/deployment.md]

- Configure `output: 'standalone'` in next.config.js for Docker deployment
- This is required for the Dockerfile multi-stage build process

### Environment Variables

[Source: architecture/environment-variables.md]

Create `.env.example` with template structure:

- Database URL placeholder
- Analytics IDs placeholders
- Email API key placeholder
- Security secrets placeholders

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Standards:**

- Test file location: `__tests__/` directory or co-located with `*.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest + React Testing Library (to be configured in later story)
- For this story: No tests required (infrastructure setup)

**Note:** Testing setup will be implemented in a later story. This story focuses on project initialization only.

### Project Structure Notes

- The `docs/` folder contains BMad artifacts and may be gitignored based on team preference
- The `ssh_run.py` file MUST be gitignored (contains VPS credentials)
- All environment files (`.env.local`, `.env`) should be gitignored

### Technical Constraints

- Next.js version must be 14.2 or higher
- TypeScript version must be 5.3 or higher
- Node.js version must be 20 LTS
- Must use App Router (not Pages Router)
