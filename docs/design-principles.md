# Design Principles - Digital Dog

## Core Design Philosophy & Strategy

### User-First Approach
- Prioritize user needs and experience in every decision
- Design for clarity and ease of use
- Minimize cognitive load through intuitive interfaces

### Simplicity & Performance
- Clean, uncluttered layouts
- Fast loading times and smooth interactions
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Design System Foundation

### Color Palette
- Primary: Define main brand colors
- Secondary: Supporting colors for hierarchy
- Neutral: Grays for text, borders, backgrounds
- Semantic: Success, warning, error, info states

### Typography
- Clear hierarchy with heading scales (H1-H6)
- Readable body text (minimum 16px)
- Consistent line heights and spacing
- Web-safe font stack with fallbacks

### Spacing System
- Consistent spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Predictable margins and padding
- White space as a design element

### Core UI Components
- Buttons with clear states (default, hover, active, disabled)
- Form inputs with proper labels and validation
- Cards with consistent structure
- Navigation elements with clear hierarchy

## Layout & Visual Hierarchy

### Responsive Grid System
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1200px
- Flexible grid that adapts to content

### Visual Hierarchy
- Strategic use of size, color, and position
- Clear content organization
- Scannable layouts with proper heading structure

### White Space
- Generous spacing between sections
- Proper line spacing for readability
- Breathing room around interactive elements

## Interaction Design & Animations

### Micro-interactions
- Purposeful animations that enhance usability

- Feedback for user actions

### Loading States
- Clear indication of progress
- Skeleton screens for content loading
- Graceful error handling

## Accessibility Standards
